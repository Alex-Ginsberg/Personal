                    <h5>Fullstack Academy of Code</h5>
                    <p class="education-description">
                        A presentation discussing different processor scheduling algorithms used by operating systems.
                        By analyzing FIFO, SJF, Round-Robin, and MFQ algorithms, we can see the purpose of each algorithm
                        and understand why certain processes use different algorithms.
                    </p>
                    <p class="education-description">
                        Beginning with an introduction to operating systems, the presentation discusses the purpose of 
                        the operating systems and how processor scheduling fits into the picture. It then looks at several
                        simple scheduling algorithms, before showing how those simple algorithms can be used to develop
                        the complex algorithms that are used by modern-day operating systems.

                    <h5>Fullstack Academy of Code</h5>
                    <p class="education-description">
                        Saffire is a progressive web app that allows users to plan trips and stay in sync with each other.
                        After creating a profile, users can add other users as friends and create travel groups.
                        These groups can then plan their trips through a sharing and voting system, that uses Google Places
                        to help user find activities to do. Once the activities are set, Saffire will form an itinerary for the group.
                        Through geolocation tracking, offline functionality, and a social media experience, Saffire keeps friends in sync
                        on the go.

                    <h5>Fullstack Academy of Code</h5>
                    <p class="education-description">
                        Drinkstagram is a mobile, social media app that creates a database of bar/restaurant ratings by using users' social media posts to create average ratings for the location the post was made.
                        Users can make social media posts based around drinks that they ordered at bars, allowing them to 
                        provide a rating and location for the drink. That information is then used to create an average 
                        rating for each bar, as well as a page for each bar that shows the most recently made posts.
