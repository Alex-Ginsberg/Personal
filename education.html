                    <h3>Fullstack Academy of Code</h3>
                    <h5>New York, NY | July 2017 - October 2017</h5>
                    <p class="education-description">
                        Fullstack Academy is a software engineering bootcamp that teaches a Javascript focused stack.
                        The program consists of 2 sections: junior and senior phase. Junior phase consists of completing
                        pair-programming wokshops that teach students the NERD stack (Node.js, Exrpess.js, React/React-Redux,
                         PostgreSQL databases). Senior phase is the chance for students to use the stack they learned to 
                         create various projects both individually and in teams of 4, allowing us to practice AGILE development.
                         Completed projects and presentations can be found in the "Projects" section of this site.

                    <h5>Richmond, VA | August 2013 - May 2017</h5>
                    <p class="education-description">
                        I received a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science with a minor in Business Administration from the University of Richmond. My CS work mainly focused on Java programming and CS fundamentals, such as data structures, algorithms, and operating systems. The CS courses I took gave me the opportunity to work both in teams and individually on large-scale projects, such as an implementation of the NACHOS operating system and a traffic simulator. My business courses taught me the fundamentals of navigating the professional world and how I am expected to perform in a professional work environment.
